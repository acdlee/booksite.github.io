                <h2>About the Book</h2>
                <p>
                    The Diary of a Wimpy Kid is a children's book first published in 2007,
                    although it was released on the educational browser game website Funbrain
                    in 2004. The story follows a young teenager named Greg Heffley on his
                    journey through the ubiquitous struggles of middle school. We tag alone
                    through Greg's journal, as he depicts and reflects the standout events 
                    of his daily life. 
                </p>
                <!-- <p>
                    Greg's journal (not diary, as he emphatically states) paints the struggles
                    of a narcissistic middle schooler who is inundated with his future, which,
                    one day, is worthy of an endless stream of personal questions, to which he'll
                    answer with this journal.
                </p> -->
                <p>
                    Traveling through early adolescene, Greg must circumnavigate interpersonal
                    relationships with his friends and family, along with his bullies and peers.
                    This story not only serves as a pertinent companion for those in Greg's age bracket,
                    but also an opportunity to reflect and learn for those of us who've forgotten our
                    similar undergoings and pre-adulthood origins.

                    <h3>Greg's First Day</h3>
                    <p>
                        The story begins with Greg's first day of middle school, where we find him 
                        writing in the journal that he so hypocritically disavows. Immediately, we see
                        Greg's perception of the world around him: a temporary hell swarmed by morons and
                        people not worthy of himself. A day later, Greg finds himself facing a moldy piece
                        of cheese on a basketball court. This particular piece is notorious: any who touch
                        the cheese is instantly infected with the "Cheese Touch" and will be ostracized
                        by their peers. Soonafter we meet Rodrick, Greg's bully of an older brother, who
                        seems to live under different rules than those set for Greg by his parents.

                    <h3>Greg Meets Rowley</h3>                   
                    <p>
                        The weekend following the first week of school, Greg heads over to <s>play</s>
                        hangout with his friend Rowley. Their friendship is quite shaky: 
                        Greg views Rowley as less than himself, and even recycles Rodrick's pranks on Rowley,
                        despite Greg considering him, techincally, his best friend. Despite Greg's 
                        concern with Rowley's effect on his image, Greg relies Rowley for his friendship, 
                        which becomes more apparent to Greg as time goes on.

                    <p>
                        After realizing the potential "social cred" achievable through status, Greg 
                        decides to pursue the Treasurer position in the school government. Greg's 
                        first campgain strategy is to sling mud (wonder where he learned that from), 
                        which of course is not allowed (in middle school), and quickly retires from 
                        school politics.

                    <h3>Greg Goes Trick or Treating</h3>            
                    <p>
                        The next big event in the journal is Halloween. After visiting a haunted 
                        house, an inspired Greg draws up a plan to create his own in Rowley's 
                        basement, along with posters to spread word. Things don't go as planned 
                        and Rowley ends up grounded, which is only concerning to Greg because 
                        "now where am I[Greg] supposed to play my video games?".

                    <h3>Greg vs Kindergarders</h3>          
                    <p>
                        As the year progresses, Greg continually looks for opportunities to 
                        self-serve, mostly at the expense of others. Being the usual recipient 
                        of Greg's narcassism, Rowley finally reaches a boiling point with Greg 
                        during their stint as Safety Patrols (which Greg is really only in for 
                        the hot cocoa). While Rowley was taking a quiz in forth period, Greg 
                        walks home a group of kindergarders. As reported by a bystander, 
                        Greg was ""terrorizing"" the kindergardners. However, Rowley recieves 
                        the blame and week-suspension punishment instead of Greg, over a 
                        misconception.

                    <p>
                        After confessing to Rowley and simulatenously trying to inject 
                        him with "lesson learned" rhetoric, the two's friendship splits. 
                        Rowley wises up and tells the truth to the head of the Safety Patrols,
                        which leaves Greg feeling backstabbed by his friend, furthering their 
                        split.

                        The two trial new friends seperately for a few months, only to return
                        to each other in conflict. Greg confronts Rowley over a comic he believes
                        they co-created. Rowley disagrees, and the peanut gallery instigates a fight
                        between the former best friends. Their fight is interupted by a group of older
                        teenagers they pranked and evaided on Halloween. Then, the unthinkable happens:
                        Rowley is forced to eat THE cheese by himself (since Greg lied and said he had
                        an allergy) and promptly was infected.

                    <p>
                        In the day that followed, the school was fierce to discover what happened 
                        to the missing cheese. For the first time in the book, Greg shows some 
                        maturity. Instead of waiting for someone to discover it was Rowley who 
                        touched (and ate) the cheese, Greg decides to claim the Cheese Touch 
                        and protect Rowley.

                <p>
                    Jeff Kinney, an author and cartoonist, was born in Maryland in 1971. 
                    During his time at the University of Maryland, he ran a comic strip

                <p>
                    After not finding more success with his comic strips, Jeff began writing
                    the initial ideas for Diary of a Wimpy Kid, which would later go on
                    to become a best selling book, recognized globally for its bestselling
                    story of Greg Heffley.
